Problem Statement

MongoBite Co. is using Cloud for one of its products. The project uses multiple modular components and frameworks and wants the components to be developed by different teams or 3rd-party vendors.

The company’s goal is to deliver product updates frequently to production with High quality & Reliability. They also want to accelerate software delivery speed, and quality and reduce feedback time between developers, testers & ops teams.

they need to implement Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment with DevOps using the following tools:

	Git – For version control for tracking changes in the code files
	Jenkins – For continuous integration and continuous deployment
	Docker – For containerizing applications ( preparing images )
	Ansible - For Setting application hosting environment & to deploy the Containers
	Docker Swarm / Kubernetes -- For hosting containerized applications ( for running containers )
	
	
This project will be about how to deploy code to dev/stage/prod etc, just with a click of a button.


============================================================================

CICD Setup: 

get a new Ubuntu VM ( free tier ) from AWS

	* install git, Java, Jenkins & setup the CI Pipeline to Generate the artifact (.war) 
	* for implementing the CD Pipeline from Jenkins follow the below steps 
	
	pre-req: create 4 VMs in aws ( free tier ) 
				2 for qa environment ( install docker & setup a docker swarm (1 manager & 1 node ))
				2 for prod environment ( install docker & setup a docker swarm (1 manager & 1 node ))

		* install docker on the Same Jenkins VM
		* build docker image from Jenkins using the artifact genereated as part of CI & Version the Image 
		* Push the Docker Image to docker hub using Jenkins
		* Install Ansible on Jenkins Machine, so that it can act as Ansible Controller
		* create Ansible Inventory with QA & PROD Server Information
		* write a playbook, which can take env & image-version as variables to deploy the image as container into QA & PROD
		* Invoke Ansible from Jenkins to Connect to QA Swarm Mananger & Deploy the Docker Containers in QA
		* if QA Deployment fails do not proceed further. 
		* Invoke Ansible from Jenkins to Connect to PROD Swarm Mananger & Deploy the Docker Containers in PROD
		
		every time pipeline runs, old version should be removed & new version should be deployed.


after building this flow, with single click / or whenever there is code change the app should be deploy till prod without manual intervention.
